Hey there! So you've got some people together and you want to play Houston under the same roof? That's awesome! This guide will help you get started; it tells you all the things you'll want to have, how people should be organized, and some tips for keeping it fun!

## The equipment

To play Houston, you'll need:
* **The Pilot Computer**: 1 computer with Kerbal Space Program and the [Telemachus](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24594-1-0-4-(2015-07-04)-Telemachus-â€“-Telemetry-and-Flight-Control-in-the-Web-Browser) mod installed. This will be the computer you [install Houston on](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/235158-houston), and the one the pilot will use when playing. Ideally, it should be powerful enough to play KSP and mirroring the display on both a monitor and a TV (more on this in the setup section).
* A TV, projector, or other large screen. This will be the screen the Pilot Computer uses.
* Computers (ideally laptops) for every other player. They don't need to be anything special or high-powered, they just need to be able to run Safari/Chrome decently well.
* Tables and Chairs for Mission Control.
* Snacks, drinks, and so forth. This is a party, after all!

## The players

Houston's designed for 5 players ideally:

### The Pilot

The one who's flying the ship directly from Kerbal Space Program. Also the one controlling the Map View in KSP, which Mission Control will make heavy use of.

### BOOST/EECOM

The person responsible for monitoring the fuel and power levels on the ship, and helps plan the power of maneuver burns (based on the current fuel levels and discussions with FIDO & SCIENCE)

### FIDO

![](https://github.com/tcannonfodder/houston/blob/master/readme-images/fido.png)

Responsible for calculating maneuvers based on current position, orbit info, and the ship's current velocity. FIDO also gets docking info and a (basic) Hohmann Transfer Tool to intercept a target, assuming the target and the ship orbit the same body.

### SCIENCE

Provides detailed information about the current target's distance, orbit, and velocity; analysis of the orbiting body; sensor readouts; and Ore levels. Essential for planning maneuvers, landings, and well... doing **SCIENCE**.

### CAPCOM

The main line of communication between the Pilot and the rest of Mission Control. Their job is to plan the next course of action, make sense of the data from Mission Control, and relay it back to the Pilot. Ideally someone who's played KSP or has a basic understanding of orbital mechanics (this mirrors the real-world, since CAPCOM's are normally astronauts themselves). CAPCOM gets 3 "overview" screens they can use to keep track of basic flight stages:

* ![](https://github.com/tcannonfodder/houston/blob/master/readme-images/ground-track.png) Ground Track (when the ship is in orbit)
* ![](https://github.com/tcannonfodder/houston/blob/master/readme-images/landing.png) Landing

You can combine roles if necessary, but we've found that having an individual at each station makes the game easier to manage and more fun. Bouncing between screens is annoying and takes away from the cooperative experience.

## Setup

Getting everything setup to make Houston a fun party can be a bit tricky, but some basic rules to follow are:

* Try to get some distance between the pilot and Mission Control. Part of the fun of Houston is the tension that comes from only having indirect control. Requiring Mission Control to make a plan, then relay that plan to the Pilot, without it being super easy to go "oh, just let me do it!" is what keeps everyone on their toes! You don't need a ton of extra space. We put the Pilot in an adjoining room, only 20 feet from Mission Control. It was just enough space to put the Pilot "out of reach" of Mission Control and made it so that the CAPCOM needs to manage communication.

* Mission Control has to be able to see KSP, ideally on a big screen. There are 2 reasons for this:
  1. Mission Control needs to see the map view in detail when planning maneuvers
  2. It gives Mission Control something to look at other than data readouts. Not every station will have something to do at every moment, so being able to sit back and watch the action unfold is crucial for Mission Control players enjoying the game.

* Keep everything within normal speaking distance. There will be a lot of chatting, either about the mission or to hang out. Trying to yell across halls or use Skype/Google Hangouts unnecessarily will just diminish the experience. Similarly, while it sounds cool in theory, we don't recommend locking the Pilot in the bathroom with some snacks. Authentic? Yes. Memorable? Yes. Fun for hours? *Ehhhh.*

For reference, here was our setup:

## Playing

* Make time for breaks, and take advantage of the natural breaks in Kerbal Space Program. Let people stretch their legs, chat over some food, and get some coffee. Houston can be a little intense at times, so these moments to unwind keep things fun for everyone.
* Don't use maneuver nodes, except as time markers. Part of the fun of KSP is doing all the maneuvers manually. There's nothing like debating when to retrograde burn to intercept an orbiting space station, or how long and powerful a plane change burn should be. Similarly, don't use an autopilot tool.
* Keep everyone involved, don't let a few folks dominate the game. It can be easy for someone to take the back seat, particularly if you have a great Pilot or CAPCOM. Everyone has something to contribute, and they probably have some data that will help! If you think someone might have something to add, ask what they think. :)
